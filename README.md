COVID19 is a newly discovered infectious disease that's spreading illness, fear, and uncertainty in all sectors of society. 
It's a challenge for individuals, businesses, organizations, and governments which makes it particularly crucial for data analysis on existing and updating information on the virus characteristis, age/sex groups that are more at risk,resources available, and effects on important institutions.

**Business Question**
Based on demographics and hospital availability, which FIPS counties are the most vulnerable or at risk during COVID19?

It's important to address this to allow policymakers in each region to implement practices like social distancing and businesses to prepare workers and supplies to support these weaker areas. 
**Data Question**
What metrics and data do we have to monitor healthcare resources and COVID19 conditions in the given counties?
