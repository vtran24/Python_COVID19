# Management for COVID19 Pandemic Through Python Data Analysis
COVID19 is a newly discovered infectious disease that's spreading illness, fear, and uncertainty in all sectors of society. 
It's a challenge for individuals, businesses, organizations, and governments which makes it particularly crucial for data analysis on existing and updating information on the virus characteristis, age/sex groups that are more at risk,resources available, and effects on important institutions. 
Effective data management can help minimize these the effects and help decision-makers better allocate resources and attention given the trends. 

**Business Question**
Based on demographics and hospital availability, which FIPS counties are the most vulnerable or at risk during COVID19?

It's important to address this to allow policymakers in each region to implement practices like social distancing and businesses to prepare workers and supplies to support these weaker areas. 

**Data Question**
What metrics and data do we have to monitor healthcare resources and COVID19 conditions in the given counties?

## Data Interpretation

The **bar chart** conveys 20 counties with the highest populations with Los Angeles County, California taking a significant lead at 10.1M; its high number of people suggests that the county is most at risk for virus transmission, but zoning into population density and certain characteristics (i.e. percent of people over the age of 60) reveal that although certain counties are less populated, they may be more at risk and thus require more attention.

As seen in the **scatter chart**, there aren't any significant counties with both a high percentage of minors and elderly, there are regions in comparison to the rest of the data where there are not many hospital bed counts. Standardizing the hospital bed counts uncovers multiple counties with a higher minors/elders population with about the same number of beds per 1000 people as counties with lower numbers of these age groups. Some counties with higher percentages of people over 60 have relatively low standardized bed counts which should prompt health and government officials to devote more resources and enact stricter policies in controlling the spread, but the otherwise similarly-sized bubbles may indicate that number of hospital beds isn't a major contributing determinant in COVID19 damage control. 

The **heat map** is consistent with the scatter plot data in that it conveys how there is no significant correlation in the number of hospital beds and COVID19-related deaths (correlation of almost 0) while conveying a slightly positive correlation with the number of deaths and the population size (of all ages). There are also low correlations between other factors like dependency ratios. This suggests that these variables don't play a large role in determining what considers a county more at risk and encourages exploring other data sources on potential contributing factors like number of human resources, social vulnerability (i.e. accessibility to housing/transportation), or medical supplies.

## Business Answer
Considering that the number of standardized hospital beds isn't very consequential in determining the county's vulnerability level and preparedness in response to COVID-10, it's more helpful to focus on the bar chart data displaying counties with the highest total population (Los Angeles County, CA; Cook County,IL and highest percentage of people over 60 (Lee County, Fl; Sarasota County, Fl)as they have the higher correlations with deaths. Princeton researchers suggest that more rural counties with a higher population of people over 60 are more at risk as there's limitation in access to resources in addition to an aging population. In response to the crises, Lee County and Sarasota county officials have rent assistance programs to prevent homelessness as well as relief funds and funds for businesses; they've enforced stricter protocols in sanitation and social distancing. Their people have been assured that their county is prepared to meet demands in public services as other resources are made available like hotlines. Further data analysis may reveal more counties with similar characteristics in which they can implement similar policies to limit the spread while supporting economy health. 

## Further Analysis
Because there is a .86 correlation between the cases per 1000 and deaths per 1000, it might be useful to analyze data on various hospitalization procedures or practices adopted post-infection as other medical resources may be more vital. Looking at datasets revealing the county's resiliency in dealing with disasters may also help as it takes into account factors like homelessness, poverty, access to transportation, etc.
